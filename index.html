            Yes, you should be choosing Orlando Studios over Disney. Don’t
            misunderstand me. Disney is great, but it is losing its magic. Cast
            members are not as nice. Prices are rising. Head over to Orlando
            Studios. Much more friendly and interactive staff. Way more helpful.
            Very vibrant and exciting park. Be sure to buy 2 park tickets if
            you’d like to see both Harry Potter Worlds. Which is a must! So
            immersive and you feel like you are in the movies! Get your butter
            beer too! Be sure to stay at an Universal Studios resort and you
            will get a complimentary lightning pass. (You pay for one at Disney,
            and soon to pay more!) I will be visiting Orlando Studios again.
            Disney - not anytime soon.

            Absolutely fantastic show. The storyline was great and the casting
            was spot on for the most part. Some of the kids of course are
            learning but they are pretty good all things considered. The best
            are of the season was definitely Jonathan Byers, Charlie Heaton one
            of the best talents today gave an amazing performance and really
            have such a complex character not seen today. His chemistry with
            Natalia Dyer is probably the greatest in TV history. And speaking of
            Natalia she was also phenomenal along with the charismatic Joe
            Keery. I really hope that season 4 really focuses on those 3
            especially Jonathan because his character was really sidelined in
            season 3.

          <p>
            I had heard so much about based on true story film, " the Conjuring
            " from word of mouth that I finally decided to check it out. And I
            had to admit that I enjoyed myself and thought it was well worth
            seeing. Everyone may have their own view as to what is considered
            really " scary" to themselves. But I have to at least say that I
            found the Conjuring definitely to be " creepy" enough to enjoy. With
            the Conjuring - which I tip my hat to the director James Wan and
            writers - because not only did I think this film had some creepy and
            jittery "jump-scare" moments in the film, but I also liked the way
            the dark areas of the house, the rooms, the corners, basement,
            stairs dark areas were displayed , they made it look eerie and
            macabre ( that's been an missing element in horror films for
            decades, IMO) Much like the room the possessed girl Regan was tied
            up in the Exorcist. Speaking of which, in terms of it being a
            demon-possession flick, it ( nor any other "entity" movie will ever
            be in that class) Slowly creaking opening doors,.. bouncing objects,
            ..strange vibrations,.. shadows in the corner, ..dark- creepy
            hallways, ..powerful stench odors, ..unexplained physical yanking
            and bruises, ..dead animals, etc. And I thought the whole haunting
            demonic origin was well told. The way the film started out did
            remind me very much of the Amityville Horror, but unlike that film
            and it's ghostly encounters, it was well explained in this film why
            the terrified family group could not just pack up and leave. I liked
            that the Conjuring more centered on atmosphere than with a lot of
            excess blood and gore and superficial CGI effects. There was only a
            couple of instants where director James Wan let that slip, primarily
            at the end. I also liked that it had a very brief documentary-like
            atmosphere where you felt part of the investigating ghost-crew with
            the rolling camera. The creepy sounding and wide screen camera
            angles were terrific and the cast and characters were well scripted
            and portrayed admirably. Particularly Lily Taylor and Vera Farmiga.
            I didn't really get into the " Annabelle " doll, which was supposed
            to be one of the " gateway" tools to which demon spirits emerged
            into the lives of the living humans, I thought that the ending which
            one gets possessed to murder,- could have been a lot more intense
            and dramatic. While the credits rolled at the end, you get to see
            the pictures of the real couple who the film was based that actually
            investigates Occult like haunting back In the 60's and 70's. Overall
            I thought this film was a solid film that gives some spooky chills
            and thrills in periods of the movie, and although I was initially
            concerned that this would be one of those films where the trailer
            itself ends up being much better, exciting that the actual movie
            itself- I can say that's not the case here, and I was very much put
            at ease on that note after I finished watching the film. This should
            easily be one of the scariest movies of the year. Too add I think
            it's an greater advantage and enjoyable thrill to see this at the
            movie theaters with the much greater sights and surrounding sounds
            vs at home on DVD or streaming. On a Scale of 1 to 10, I'd give The
            Conjuring a 9.0

            It is the most amazing show I have ever seen. It is just what I
            love, friendship, adventures, love, mystery and legendary. IT IS
            SOOO AMAZING! I defenitely recommend all ages to watch this show cuz
            once you do, you can't stop. It is also very relatable. It is very
            real and it makes us feel like these are the things that are really
            happening in their lives and it just comes alive like the WHOLE
            thing. I really love it.... Thank you for the wonderful show! Also
            can't believe that this is just a show.😄 Every time I hear this
            show mentioned or even think about it, it brings a tear to my
            eye.The part where mel's mother dies, it makes me sooooooooooooo
            saaaddd and i will fall into tears and whenever i see mel's face, it
            reminds me of Laura. There are kids and adults too who can very much
            relate to it.
